# What is React?

A library for building UI



* React is the agent between you and the browser \(acts like a fake browser\)

* Updating DOM relatively expensive; React makes this efficient

* Declarative syntax

## Remember this pattern!

```js
function UIComponent(data){
    return UIElement
}

// Or, for those ES6-inclined

const UIComponent(data) => {
    return UIElement
}
```
