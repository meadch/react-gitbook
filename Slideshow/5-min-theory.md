# What is React?

A library for building UI

## Why is it so popular?

* React is the agent between you and the browser \(acts like a fake browser\)

* Updating DOM relatively expensive; React makes this efficient

* Declarative syntax

## Remember this pattern!

```js
function ChunkOfUI(data){
    return UI
}
```
