# Introduction to Application State


State is what makes web applications so difficult to architect. The term refers to the condition of data -- be it who's logged in, what URL is requested, etc -- that's needed to figure out what the browser needs to show the user. That's about it.

It's really important to get a feel for this notion of state before we dive into react, so take a few minutes and do the following:

Update the JavaScript object to describe the state of a simple todo application:

```js
var state = { /* Your code here */ };
```

There are tons of potential answers to this challenge —- the main goal is to get you thinking about all the pieces of information you’ll want to track.
